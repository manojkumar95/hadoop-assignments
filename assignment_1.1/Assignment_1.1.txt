3. Volume - The amount of data it can store.



3. Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling

4. Need and Working of Hadoop



Needs:


*It provides single version of truth.

*Faster data processing.



Working:

     Hadoop is an open source software to handle large amount of data.
Its core part consists of storage part known as Hadoop Distributed File Systems(HDFS) and
the processing part know as MapReduce programming model.
Hadoop splits the data into larger blocks and
distributes them across the nodes of the cluster.
