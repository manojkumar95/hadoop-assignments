1. Explain the importance of Name node in Hadoop cluster

Answer:
The NameNode is an important constituent of the HDFS file system. 
• Contains the Hadoop FileSystem Tree and other metadata information about files and directories 
• Contains in-memory mapping of which blocks are stored in which datanode
• Namenode does not store data of any files.
Namenode can be used to perform operations such as add/copy/move/delete a file. 
The NameNode responds the successful requests by returning a list of relevant DataNode servers where the data lives.
The NameNode is a Single Point of Failure for the HDFS Cluster. 
HDFS is not currently a High Availability system. 
When the NameNode goes down, the file system goes offline. 

• NameNode contains two important files on its hard disk:
1. fsimage (file system image)
It contains:
• All directory structure of HDFS
• Replication level of file
• Modification and access times of files
• Access permissions of files and directories
• Block size of files
• The blocks constituting a file
2. Edits
• When any write operation takes place in HDFS, the directory structure gets modified
• These modifications are stored in the memory as well as in edits files (edits files are stored on hard disk)
• If existing fsimage file gets merged with edits, we’ll get an updated fsimage file
• This process is called Checkpointing and is carried out by the Secondary NameNode. 
  It takes fsimage and edits files from NameNode and returns updated fsimage file after merging.
2. Practice the beginners commands for HDFS from the below link
https://acadgild.com/blog/hdfs-commands-for-beginners/

Answer:

1. Put Command
The 'put' command feeds the data in to the HDFS.
Syntax: hadoop dfs –put </source path> </destination path>

2. List Command
The ‘list’ command displays all the available files inside a particular path.
Syntax: hadoop dfs –ls </source path>

3.Get Command
The ‘get’ command copies the entire contents of the mentioned file to the local drive.
Syntax: hadoop dfs –get </source path> </destination path>

4. Make Directory Command
The ‘mkdir’ command creates a new directory in the specified location.
Syntax: hadoop dfs –mkdir </source path>

5. View contents of particular file
The ‘cat’ command is used to display all the contents of a file.
Syntax: hadoop dfs –cat </path[filename]>

6.Duplicating a Complete File inside the HDFS.
The ‘copyfromlocal’ command will copy file from the local file system to the HDFS.
Syntax: hadoop dfs –copyFromLocal </source path> </destination path>

7.Duplicating a File from HDFS to the Local File System.
The ‘copytolocal’ command will copy files from the HDFS to the local file system.
Syntax: hadoop dfs –copyToLocal </source path> </destination path>

8.Removing the File
The command ‘rm’ will delete the file stored inside the HDFS.
Syntax: hadoop dfs –rm </path[filename]>

9.Run a DFS Filesystem to Check Utility
The command ‘fsck’ is used for checking the consistency of a file system
Syntax: hadoop fsck </file path>

10.Run a Cluster Balancing Utility
The command ‘balancer’ will check for work load on nodes in cluster and balance it.
Syntax: hadoop balancer

11.Check Directory Space in HDFS
The command will show the file size occupied by file inside cluster.
Syntax: hadoop dfs -du -s -h </file path>

12. List all the Hadoop File System Shell Commands
The ‘fs’ command lists down all the shell commands of the Hadoop File System.
Syntax: hadoop fs [options]

13.Asking for Help
The ‘help’ command is for asking for help or querying a particular question.
Command: hadoop fs -help
